# Fibonacci-Processor-Simulation---Logisim
This project implements a simple processor in Logisim capable of executing a custom instruction set to calculate and store a sequence of Fibonacci numbers. It was created as part of an assignment to test store and move instructions, memory writing, and program control flow within a hardware simulation environment.
